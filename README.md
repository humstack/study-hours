## Machine Learning Project to Predict How a Student's Study Hours affect Academic Performance
# Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML
Steps:
1. Used Pandas libary to fetch the data as a DataFrame
2. Split the DataFrame data into features and labels
3. Split the data into training and test data using sklearn's train_test_split function
4. Created the first model, tested results using test data and visualized the results
5. Repeated the procedure until the loss decreases significantly while tweaking hyperparameters to optimize model performance
6. Used the final model to predict the result of a student studying for 9.25 hours.
